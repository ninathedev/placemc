# placemc
r/place, but 3D

## rerquirements:
- everyone MUST be in creative
- dont let them escape the canvas :)

## currently added features:
- disallowing item drops from falling blocks and from players
- hides others players (hopefully)
- reload the config (yay!)
- actually implement the place :)
- add blocks that cant be placed or broke
- add breakonlymode (whiteout in r/place), pausemode (stops breaking and placing), and resumemode (allows breaking and placing once more)

to copy the canvas, use multiverse!
