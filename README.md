# placemc
r/place, but 3D

## rerquirements:
- everyone MUST be in creative
- dont let them escape the canvas :)

## currently added features:
- disallowing item drops from falling blocks and from players
- hides others players (hopefully)
- reload the config (yay!)

## todo
- actually implement the place :)
- add blocks that cant be placed or broke
- add a command to copy the canvas, then only allow players to break blocks (no more placing)
